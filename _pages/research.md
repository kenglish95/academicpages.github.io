I am currently undertaking my PhD in Sociology researching how differences of sex, gender and sexuality should be represented by UK population surveys. The research focuses on the perspectives of those currently overlooked in survey data. To achieve this a sequential mixed-methods research design is employed. This research is funded by the University of Glasgowâ€™s College of Social Sciences (CoSS) Scholarship.
